# Company-Network-System-Project

# 1. Background
Amidst the dynamic landscape of contemporary computer networks, the "Company Network System Design" initiative addresses the pressing need for a secure, scalable, and efficient network infrastructure to support the operational requirements of a growing industrial environment. With the organization expanding its departments and integrating multiple operational units within a single interconnected system, the strategic significance of routing, switching, and security configurations takes center stage, playing a crucial role in ensuring seamless communication, reliable data transfer, and controlled access to resources. This project focuses on designing and implementing a robust network that connects various departments such as IT, Security, Dispatch, Store, Packing Plant, Mines Office, and Crusher Office, while integrating servers and wireless access points to enhance operational efficiency. The entire design and implementation process has been carried out using Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate, test, and validate network configurations before deployment.

# 2. Objectives
The primary objectives of the "Company System Network Design" initiative are clearly outlined to cater to the unique demands of the organization’s network infrastructure. The project aims to implement dynamic routing using Routing Information Protocol (RIP) for efficient inter-network communication, configure Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for automated IP address allocation, and deploy Secure Shell (SSH) for secure remote device management. It seeks to implement port security to restrict unauthorized access, create multiple Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) to logically segment departmental traffic for improved security and performance, and integrate wireless access points to provide mobility across departments. Additionally, the project includes the deployment of three dedicated servers: an Active Directory server for centralized authentication, a Darktrace server for network monitoring and threat detection, and an RFID server for access control and attendance tracking. By achieving these objectives, the project establishes a secure, reliable, and future-ready network infrastructure that not only meets current operational requirements but also anticipates and accommodates the organization’s growth and technological advancements.
